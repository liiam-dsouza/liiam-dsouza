## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hello! I'm Liam D'Souza, a fourth-year software engineering student at the Queensland University of Technology. I have a strong interest in emerging technologies including AI and cyber security, And I'm most passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems and enjoy working on projects that combine innovation, collaboration and creative thinking to create meaningful impact.

On my GitHub you'll find repos for some of the smaller side projects I'm working on, larger projects I've completed throughout my university studies, and materials for some of my talks and workshops that I run - covering topics like using the command line for beginners, and the future of artificial intelligence development with practical demos of LLMs, MCP and agentic AI using n8n.

Follow me on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/liiam_dsouza) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/liiam-dsouza/) to see what I'm working on, check out my [website](https://liamdsouza.com), or send me a message if you'd like to chat.
